# ATM System

### **Purpose**

The idea is to create a mini project as a test for active recall of all the programming fundamentals learn trough this two weeks. So the Mini Project will need to use the next topics:
Variables | Data types | Arithmetic operations | Logical and relational operators | Control flow structures ( conditionals & loops) | functions | User interaction (printf - scanf - fgets)

### **üìù Basic Instructions:**

1. The ATM should allow users to interact with a **menu** that provides different banking options.
2. The user should be able to perform **basic operations** like checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.
3. Ensure the program follows proper **user input handling** and prevents invalid transactions (e.g., overdrafts).
4. The program should **loop** until the user decides to exit.

### **‚ùì Questions to Guide You:**

1. **User Interaction:**
    
    - How will you display a **menu** for user choices?
    - What inputs will the user need to provide? (`scanf`, `fgets`?)
    - How will you handle invalid inputs?
2. **Data Handling:**
    
    - What variables will you need to store the **account balance** and transactions?
    - What data type is best for money-related calculations?
3. **Logic & Conditions:**
    
    - How will you handle **withdrawals** if the user tries to take out more than their balance?
    - How will you ensure **deposits** update the balance correctly?
4. **Functions:**
    
    - How can you structure the program using **functions**?
    - What functions will you need? (e.g., `check_balance()`, `withdraw()`, `deposit()`)
5. **Loop & Exit Condition:**
    
    - How will you keep the program running until the user **chooses to exit**?
    - What kind of loop will you use (`while`, `do-while`)?

### **üí° Bonus Challenges (If You Want More Difficulty!)**

- Add a **PIN system** that requires the user to enter a correct PIN before accessing the account.
- Implement a **daily withdrawal limit** to simulate real ATM restrictions.
- Keep track of **transaction history** and display the last 5 transactions.
