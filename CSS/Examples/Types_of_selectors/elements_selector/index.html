    <h2>The Sun is a Star</h2>
    <p>
        The Sun is, in fact, a star â€“ a massive ball of hot gas that emits light and heat. It's the center of our solar system, and its gravity holds everything else in orbit.

    <h2>Space is Nearly Silent</h2>
    <p>
        Since sound waves need a medium to travel through, space, being a vacuum, is almost entirely silent.  Astronauts use radio waves to communicate.

    <h2>There are More Stars Than Grains of Sand</h2>
    <p>
        It's estimated that the universe contains more stars than there are grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. That's a truly staggering number!
    </p>

    <h2>The Largest Planet is Jupiter</h2>
    <p>
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system.  It's so big that you could fit all the other planets inside it.
    </p>

    <h2>A Day on Venus is Longer Than a Year</h2>
    <p>
         Venus has a very slow axial rotation. A single day on Venus (the time it takes to spin once on its axis) is longer than its orbital period around the Sun (its year).
