          Puppy food should be formulated to support rapid growth. Look for
          these essential nutrients:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Protein:</strong> Essential for muscle development. Should
            be from high-quality sources like meat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fat:</strong> Provides energy and supports brain
            development. Look for healthy fats like DHA.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Calcium and Phosphorus:</strong> Crucial for bone growth.
            The ratio is very important.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Provide energy. Should be from
            easily digestible sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vitamins and Minerals:</strong> Support overall health and
            immune function.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Important Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>AAFCO Statement:</strong> Ensure the food is labeled with an
            AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) statement
            indicating it's suitable for growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Life Stage:</strong> Choose food specifically formulated for
            puppies, not "all life stages."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Breed Size:</strong> Consider your puppy's breed size
            (small, medium, large) as their nutritional needs vary. Large breed
            puppies need controlled calcium and phosphorus levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ingredients:</strong> Look for high-quality, named meat
            sources (e.g., "chicken," not "meat meal") as the first ingredients.
            Avoid artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Digestibility:</strong> Choose food with easily digestible
            ingredients to prevent digestive upset.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h3>AAFCO Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Ensure the puppy food is labeled with an AAFCO (Association of
            American Feed Control Officials) statement, indicating it meets the
            nutritional requirements for a puppy's growth stage.

          <h3>Life Stage</h3>
          <p>
            Choose food specifically formulated for puppies, rather than food
            labeled for "all life stages". Puppy-specific formulas have the
            right balance of nutrients for growth.

          <h3>Breed Size</h3>
          <p>
            Consider your puppy's breed size (small, medium, large), as their
            nutritional needs vary. Large-breed puppies, for example, require
            controlled levels of calcium and phosphorus to support proper bone
            development.
